"""graphed-awkward: the reference backend (awkward typetracer forms + real evaluation), plan M3.

``op_form`` uses the awkward **typetracer** (metadata only -- no event data is read); ``eval_stage``
uses real awkward. The ``gak`` namespace mirrors the awkward API so corpus analyses record a
backend-agnostic graph. External inputs (correctionlib corrections, ONNX models) record ``External``
nodes with a content-hashed ``PayloadDescriptor``. Reuse awkward/correctionlib/ONNX -- invent nothing.
